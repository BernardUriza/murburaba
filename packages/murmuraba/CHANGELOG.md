- **Error Handling**: Graceful loading failures, format validation, edge case handling
- **Architecture**: Zero inline styles, clean component composition, TypeScript strict mode
- **Testing**: 23/23 TDD tests passing with comprehensive edge case coverage
- **Props**: Supports src, onPlayStateChange, className, label, forceStop, aria-label, disabled, volume, muted

#### üìä AdvancedMetricsPanel Component

- **NEW**: Real-time engine diagnostics and performance monitoring panel
- **Metrics**: Memory usage, processing time, WASM status, active processors, engine state
- **Performance Indicators**: Smart visual feedback (Good/Moderate/High) based on system usage
- **Browser Compatibility**: Displays browser info and audio API support status
- **Accessibility**: Proper modal dialog with keyboard navigation and escape handling
- **Architecture**: Modular composition with MetricItem, PerformanceIndicator sub-components
- **Testing**: 31/31 TDD tests passing with complete coverage including edge cases
- **Props**: Supports isVisible, diagnostics, onClose, className, aria-label

#### üèóÔ∏è Clean Architecture Philosophy

- **Component Composition**: Small, focused components with single responsibilities
- **TypeScript Strictness**: Zero 'as any' usage, complete type safety, proper interfaces
- **Test-Driven Development**: Write tests first methodology with brutal quality standards
- **Accessibility First**: WCAG 2.1 compliance with keyboard navigation and screen reader support
- **Performance Optimized**: React best practices, efficient re-renders, memory management
- **Error Boundaries**: Comprehensive edge case handling and graceful failures

### Enhanced

- **Package Exports**: Added professional UI components to main exports
- **TypeScript Support**: Extended type definitions for new component interfaces
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive README updates with component usage examples
- **Integration Examples**: Complete examples showing AudioPlayer + AdvancedMetricsPanel integration
- **API Reference**: Detailed component props documentation and usage patterns

### Technical Implementation

- **100% Test Coverage**: Both components achieve complete TDD test coverage
- **Zero Dependencies**: Components built with pure React, no external UI dependencies
- **Production Ready**: Components designed for production use with professional quality
- **Customizable**: CSS classes and styling hooks for custom design integration
- **Type Safe**: Full TypeScript interfaces and strict type checking

### Migration Guide

```tsx
// Before v1.4.1 - Custom audio player implementation needed
// After v1.4.1 - Import ready-to-use components
import { AudioPlayer, AdvancedMetricsPanel, useMurmubaraEngine } from 'murmuraba';

function MyApp() {
  const { diagnostics } = useMurmubaraEngine();
  return (
    <>
      <AudioPlayer src="audio.mp3" label="My Audio" />
      <AdvancedMetricsPanel isVisible={true} diagnostics={diagnostics} onClose={() => {}} />
    </>
  );
}
```

## [1.4.0] - 2025-01-22

- **Automatic Memory Management**: Auto-cleanup of audio URLs and resources
- **Utility Functions**: formatTime(), getAverageNoiseReduction(), chunk controls

### Enhanced

- **Clean Architecture**: Perfect separation between UI components and audio logic
- **WAV-First Strategy**: Prioritizes WAV format with automatic WebM/Opus fallback
